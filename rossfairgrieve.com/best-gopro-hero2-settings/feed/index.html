		<description><![CDATA[Hi Luke. I haven&#039;t actually got the Hero 3 yet but I have got a couple on the way. I&#039;ll post something up when I get them. Unless there are any funny surprises, the advice will probably be a little bit different but not far off. I&#039;m expecting the 2.7k mode to be the best for normal speed and the 1080p-60fps or 720p-120fps to be the ones to go for for slow-mo, depending on what&#039;s more important out of quality and slow...ness (is that a word!?). I&#039;ll let you know when I get hold of them and test them out.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Ross, 
Great tips, really helpful. I&#039;ve just gotten the GoPro3 black edition and was trying to find a similar article to the &#039;best gopro hd 2 settings&#039; for it. Are you thinking of doing one? Or would the advice from it be transferable to the hero 3? 
Thanks!]]></description>
