		<description><![CDATA[Haha, that&#039;s definitely one of the most entertaining camera-based comments that I&#039;ve read on here! I agree about the noise on the GH4. I owned one for a bit and just couldn&#039;t get on with it in anything other than really controlled lighting situations. I&#039;ve got an A7s original and, in the non-log modes, the image is very clean but the highlights are a bit weird and make people look like they&#039;re glowing (less in the &quot;joys of spring&quot; way...more &quot;winter vomiting bug&quot;). In S-log2 the dynamic range and highlight roll-off are nice but the noise floor does start to become apparent and you have to find/build a good LUT to deal with it rather from twiddling sliders and hoping for the best. From my experience, the FS700 has horrible highlight roll-off when not shooting in Slog and a weird purple-y blue tint that&#039;s really hard to get rid of. I plucked for an FS7 which has proved to be really, really nice. Combine it with some flavour of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bertdegraeve.com/single-post/2016/1/28/Customized-Slog3-LUT-to-match-the-Arri-AmiraAlexaAlexa-Mini&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Bert Degraeve&#039;s Arri-like LUT for S-log3&lt;/a&gt; and you get nice clean footage with buttery smooth highlights and really nice colours. It&#039;s not cheap though and you might have to add the cost of a good chiropractor by the time you beef up tripods, sliders etc.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Having had a GH2 and a GH4 for production (produced a very nice music video for a client using a &#039;hacked&#039; GH2 and it was incredible. Behaved very (I mean VERY) close to a C100. Not many issues with noise. Love the camera. Strapped an Angenieux to it and it sings. Its like a ballerina.

The GH4? Oh dear. Oh dear. (Repeat 10 times more). Did this really come from the same stable? If so then its a mule and it does not carry anything but insidious criticism. Defending the GH4 is a lot like Windows users trying to defend Microslop in comparison to the Mac. 
The GH4 is a noise monster. Noise. As in those little flies that love dancing around in darkness. Even at its lowest setting of 320 its like singing in the rain in the shadows (and most other times in everything else that thinks its a shadow). 
Add VLOG to it (which I did and it cost me nearly a 100 quid) and it is worse. Not to mention the fact that it shoves you up an ISO setting to 400. I have seen less grain in a barrel of barley. I produced far better results in manually &#039;tuning&#039; the camera and filming in Cinelike D.

You might ask what I shot it with, how I shot it (TTR or any other magic you can add) but since I have been &#039;digitally&#039; filming since Back to the Future promoted the GH1 and owned and used the &#039;Mac Daddy&#039; of cameras with the Sony PC120, along with every pro camera with a 3CCD chip for high end work, I should know cameras.

OK, I am being unfair. The GH4 LOVES light (best shot on the surface of the sun, I hasten to add) but what camera doesn&#039;t like tons of light? But if using the GH4 then phone rent-a-turck-of-light and have them truck in about 10 times the amount you think you need.

I need a broad stretch on a cam (not talking about &#039;Dynamic Range&#039; since the GH4 has about 2 under its 8 claim so not really dynamic and no range at all) It is not a pain to work with. It is a nightmare. The menus are like a chapter of War and Peace and elements I loved on the GH2 for quick &#039;run n gun&#039; work have been well and gotten rid of. Panasonic, what WERE you thinking when you designed this filmmaking wanna be? 
No idea, but time to wake up before you shove the new replacement claiming to film in 6k. You need to get rid of the noise not ask pop group, Slade to order you some. (Showing my age. Standard).

This camera is seriously not worth the hype (which i bought it on the back of and did extensive research) and does nothing like that wonderful Paris promo on YouTube (which looks like it was probably a Panasonic commission and made with a Red).

Oh jeepus. The GH4, along with its set of quite expensive (and very stiff zoom and focus) pieces of plastic has now been laid to rest with a new owner whom I wish a lot of luck, a lot of prayer (he might need that from the depression he will certainly suffer) and I wish him well.

Me? I&#039;m looking at either a Sony A7s ii (poignant given the post) or a Sony FS700R. Or a Red Raven if I can sell the wife and her two Chihuahuas.
OK, I am being unfair. I love dogs. Maybe I will loan Casey Neistat my wife. He seems to lose everything.

Pity I cannot find a decent, low light, high spec, WDR and 4k beast. Somewhere. On this planet. Oh me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If Sony would only implement 10 bit 4K output and a global shutter on the A7s, they would easily corner the market and wipe everyone else out.  Instead, naturally, they are short-sighted, looking to protect their pro division, and therefore they deliberately limit the usefulness of anything at this price point.  Blackmagic is the only company doing its level best to keep pushing the envelope in order to give customers the best bang for the buck.  Unfortunately, massive companies like Sony and Panasonic have much more experience behind them, so it is hard for the super cool upstarts like Blackmagic to catch up...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, I agree with you on that Darren. In a lot of cases, I don&#039;t think 10-bit is that critical but, when Sony are including a very flat Slog-2 gamma curve and going the low megapixel, high dynamic range route, it screams 10-bit! I certainly think the HDMI out should have been 10-bit, even if the internal recording was only 8-bit.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A7S with 10 Bit output. Job done. Why is it when you think a manufacturer has just ticked all the boxes they fall short in what is to me a vital and important area! Wonder if this could be fixed with a firmware update or the people at Magic Lantern could hack it. I have a feeling probably not as I would speculate it is a hardware limitation. I would have bought this camera but am not going to now and instead wait to see what Canon do with the 5DMkIV. Other than that a great camera.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s a nice idea Roger but the Odyssey7Q doesn&#039;t support 4K over HDMI, only over SDI which the Sony a7s doesn&#039;t have. I think the HDMI port on the Odyssey7Q is HDMI 1.4, not the newer and higher bandwidth HDMI 2.0 which is needed for 4K, so it&#039;s unlikely that Convergent Design will be able to enable 4K recording via HDMI with a firmware update.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The 4k Odyssey 7Q does not have to be &quot;plugged into the wall&quot;.
It comes with a choice of battery plates including one for the Sony F970.
The codec is included for 1080 P60 and 4k recording.
It has a 7 inch high resolution touchscreen.
Downside is up to two $400 + propietary SSD discs are necesary for recording.
They were announced about this time last year and are available now.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, I guess we&#039;ll just have to wait for a bit more footage to make it into the wild. I have to say, I&#039;ve seen a couple of things in the little bit of a7s footage that&#039;s around, that does look worryingly like it could have a bit of a rolling shutter problem. I hope I&#039;m wrong!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m leaning gh4 currently myself.  Having to purchase an add-on box for 4k kinda defeats the purpose of a dslr in the first place.   I&#039;n sure the A7&#039;s gonna be great, but I&#039;m going to pass since I believe Sony will have something with internal 4krecording soon anyway and the A7 seems like a rush job for not having this from the start.   For now, the codecs on the GH4 are better for 4k and 1080 and we haven&#039;t seen any examples from the A7 yet that show any real camera movement.  The rolling shutter from this beast just might be terrible. We still don&#039;t know.]]></description>
