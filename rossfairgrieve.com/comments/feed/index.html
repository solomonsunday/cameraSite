		<description><![CDATA[Haha, that&#039;s definitely one of the most entertaining camera-based comments that I&#039;ve read on here! I agree about the noise on the GH4. I owned one for a bit and just couldn&#039;t get on with it in anything other than really controlled lighting situations. I&#039;ve got an A7s original and, in the non-log modes, the image is very clean but the highlights are a bit weird and make people look like they&#039;re glowing (less in the &quot;joys of spring&quot; way...more &quot;winter vomiting bug&quot;). In S-log2 the dynamic range and highlight roll-off are nice but the noise floor does start to become apparent and you have to find/build a good LUT to deal with it rather from twiddling sliders and hoping for the best. From my experience, the FS700 has horrible highlight roll-off when not shooting in Slog and a weird purple-y blue tint that&#039;s really hard to get rid of. I plucked for an FS7 which has proved to be really, really nice. Combine it with some flavour of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bertdegraeve.com/single-post/2016/1/28/Customized-Slog3-LUT-to-match-the-Arri-AmiraAlexaAlexa-Mini&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Bert Degraeve&#039;s Arri-like LUT for S-log3&lt;/a&gt; and you get nice clean footage with buttery smooth highlights and really nice colours. It&#039;s not cheap though and you might have to add the cost of a good chiropractor by the time you beef up tripods, sliders etc.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Having had a GH2 and a GH4 for production (produced a very nice music video for a client using a &#039;hacked&#039; GH2 and it was incredible. Behaved very (I mean VERY) close to a C100. Not many issues with noise. Love the camera. Strapped an Angenieux to it and it sings. Its like a ballerina.

The GH4? Oh dear. Oh dear. (Repeat 10 times more). Did this really come from the same stable? If so then its a mule and it does not carry anything but insidious criticism. Defending the GH4 is a lot like Windows users trying to defend Microslop in comparison to the Mac. 
The GH4 is a noise monster. Noise. As in those little flies that love dancing around in darkness. Even at its lowest setting of 320 its like singing in the rain in the shadows (and most other times in everything else that thinks its a shadow). 
Add VLOG to it (which I did and it cost me nearly a 100 quid) and it is worse. Not to mention the fact that it shoves you up an ISO setting to 400. I have seen less grain in a barrel of barley. I produced far better results in manually &#039;tuning&#039; the camera and filming in Cinelike D.

You might ask what I shot it with, how I shot it (TTR or any other magic you can add) but since I have been &#039;digitally&#039; filming since Back to the Future promoted the GH1 and owned and used the &#039;Mac Daddy&#039; of cameras with the Sony PC120, along with every pro camera with a 3CCD chip for high end work, I should know cameras.

OK, I am being unfair. The GH4 LOVES light (best shot on the surface of the sun, I hasten to add) but what camera doesn&#039;t like tons of light? But if using the GH4 then phone rent-a-turck-of-light and have them truck in about 10 times the amount you think you need.

I need a broad stretch on a cam (not talking about &#039;Dynamic Range&#039; since the GH4 has about 2 under its 8 claim so not really dynamic and no range at all) It is not a pain to work with. It is a nightmare. The menus are like a chapter of War and Peace and elements I loved on the GH2 for quick &#039;run n gun&#039; work have been well and gotten rid of. Panasonic, what WERE you thinking when you designed this filmmaking wanna be? 
No idea, but time to wake up before you shove the new replacement claiming to film in 6k. You need to get rid of the noise not ask pop group, Slade to order you some. (Showing my age. Standard).

This camera is seriously not worth the hype (which i bought it on the back of and did extensive research) and does nothing like that wonderful Paris promo on YouTube (which looks like it was probably a Panasonic commission and made with a Red).

Oh jeepus. The GH4, along with its set of quite expensive (and very stiff zoom and focus) pieces of plastic has now been laid to rest with a new owner whom I wish a lot of luck, a lot of prayer (he might need that from the depression he will certainly suffer) and I wish him well.

Me? I&#039;m looking at either a Sony A7s ii (poignant given the post) or a Sony FS700R. Or a Red Raven if I can sell the wife and her two Chihuahuas.
OK, I am being unfair. I love dogs. Maybe I will loan Casey Neistat my wife. He seems to lose everything.

Pity I cannot find a decent, low light, high spec, WDR and 4k beast. Somewhere. On this planet. Oh me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello

Thank you very much for your tips!

Actually it was easy to execute.

In my PC it is much better now but it still jerks a little bit.

Is there anything I can do?

Thanks]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[mmm...great info, the only issue is that it does not solve my problem. 
I created a .mov file (took around 2 hours as the gopro file is 6gb before codec conversion). Maybe the issue is here as the instructions say that it will be really quick.
When I play the .mov with VLC the video picture is static (unless I manually move the progress bar) but the sound plays fine. With Film &#038; TV player I get sound but no picture. 
Previously before converting the .mp4 file - VLC was very choppy and distorted but sound was good. Film&#038;TV was better and mostly / sort of worked OK after it had buffered the video]]></description>
