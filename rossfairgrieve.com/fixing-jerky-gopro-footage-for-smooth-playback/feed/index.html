		<description><![CDATA[Hello

Thank you very much for your tips!

Actually it was easy to execute.

In my PC it is much better now but it still jerks a little bit.

Is there anything I can do?

Thanks]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[mmm...great info, the only issue is that it does not solve my problem. 
I created a .mov file (took around 2 hours as the gopro file is 6gb before codec conversion). Maybe the issue is here as the instructions say that it will be really quick.
When I play the .mov with VLC the video picture is static (unless I manually move the progress bar) but the sound plays fine. With Film &#038; TV player I get sound but no picture. 
Previously before converting the .mp4 file - VLC was very choppy and distorted but sound was good. Film&#038;TV was better and mostly / sort of worked OK after it had buffered the video]]></description>
