		<description><![CDATA[Personal preference I guess Markus. For out-and-out image quality, I absolutely agree that the D800 is the better camera but there are real-world idiosyncrasies of each camera that effect how you use it and whether you can get that image. For me, the faster frame rates, slightly more solid auto focus performance, better implementation of live view etc, just about make up for the D800&#039;s better DR and higher resolution. For IQ, yep the D800 wins but, as complete photo making machine, I put them about even. Why can&#039;t one camera just have all of this hey!?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting write-up, but a D800 and 5D Mk III  &#034;a tie for stills&#034;?  That&#039;s generous in favor of the 5D III.  Are two frame additional motor drive that important?  Anyway, FPS for photography has nothing to do with IQ, and the D800 IQ is way ahead of the 5D III, which has mediocre DR performance.  Anyway, nice list.]]></description>
